Functional programming languages
Haskell is a functional programming language.

In imperative programming languages, function definitions are a sequence of imperative statements.

In functional programming languages, function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values.

Programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

Function composition
Function composition is the act of pipelining the result of one function, to the input of another, creating an entirely new function

Like the usual composition of functions in mathematics, the result of each function is passed as the argument of the next, and the result of the last one is the result of the whole.

For example, suppose we have two functions f and g:

y=f(x)
z=g(y)
Composing them means we first compute f(x) to get y, and then use y as an argument to compute g(y) to get z.

Creating a function that goes from x to z:

z=g(f(x))
And that's how we can create arbitrarily complex functions by composing simple functions.

For example, if we have:

A function that takes a spreadsheet and returns the list of players it contains.
A function that takes a list of players and returns the same list sorted by scores.
And a function that takes a list of players and returns the first 3.
We could create a single function that takes a spreadsheet and returns the 3 best players by composing those three functions.

Also, Haskell has explicit effects (also called pure üëº)!

Explicit effects (purely functional)
Purely functional programming languages treat all computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

In mathematics, the expression y=x+1 means that the value of y is a function that depends on x.

For a specific x, the value of y will always be the same.

No matter if you're in Italy or Spain, if it's 1994 or 2022, or if you have other equations in the notebook. y will care about the value of x and nothing else.

In purely functional programming languages, pure functions depend only on their arguments and don't interact with any global or local state. (This is called having "no side effects.")

This means that, for a specific input, a function will always return the same value. Every time.

It sounds like a bad idea, but if you think about it, it has some extremely convenient consequences:

It lets you easily deduce and prove that a function is correct.
In Haskell, one can always ‚Äúreplace equals by equals‚Äù, just like you learned in algebra class.
Makes your code significantly less error-prone.
It's easier to do parallel/concurrent computing. (If there is no data dependency between two pure expressions, then they can be performed in parallel, and they cannot interfere with one another.)
The list goes on...
Haskell works as a pure language, but allows for side effects (network communication, I/O, etc.) by explicitly tagging them in the type system. We'll see how in future lessons. (This is called having "explicit effects").

Haskell type system
We will cover Haskell type system in depth in lesson 2. Here you will learn some basics.

Types are attributes that constraint the values a piece of code can have. For example, if you indicate that some data is a number, that data could have any of these values:

  32

  9999695939294

  0.5
But, if you try to add a character in there, like this: 6A3 (instead of 63), the compiler/interpreter will yell at you.

What your compiler/interpreter did just there is called "type checking." Some languages have more strongly enforced type checking, some less.

  6A3
Type checking
Type checking is the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types.

What does this mean? It means that each type has its own constraints (E.g., you can't do math with letters.), and this process checks that those constraints are respected.

Why would you do this? To avoid preventable mistakes.

Dynamically typed languages
If further along in your program, you want to add up some numbers and one of them has a letter, the program wouldn't know what to do, and it would crash on you. Those are preventable mistakes (bugs), and the compiler/interpreter helps you avoid them.

Usually, this is done automatically. But not all languages do this the same way. There are two main distinctions regarding as to WHEN the types are checked: Dynamically typed languages and Statically typed languages.

Dynamically typed languages check the types at run-time.

Run-time is the very last thing that you do with a program. It's the stage when you run your program to test it or use it.

Common examples of dynamically typed languages include JavaScript, Python, Objective-C, and PHP.

Statically typed languages
Statically typed languages check the types at compile-time.

Meaning that you'll know if your types are wrong as soon as you compile your program. Which leads to a safer and more optimized code.

Common examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, and C++.

Haskell type system
Haskell is statically typed. And, in Haskell, every expression has a type.

But don't worry, you don't have to manually define the types of every expression because Haskell's compiler is very good at type inference.

Type inference allows Haskell to infer the types on its own.

If you write something like 3 + 4, Haskell will know that the result of that expression is a number, and it will treat it like it without the need for you to specify the type. (It works with more complicated expressions, too. See previous examples.)

That allows the compiler to comprehend and reason quite a lot about your program. Providing you with a pretty effective bug-catching assistant.

Even though it's not needed for the compiler, it's considered good practice to write out the type signature of top-level functions and expressions. To improve code readability.

If the code is too ambiguous for the compiler to infer the type, it'll ask you to specify the type.

Laziness
Haskell is lazy. This means that it won't evaluate expressions until their results are needed

Haskell is a statically typed, lazy, functional programming language with explicit effects and functions that look like this:

volumeOfACylinder r h = pi * r^2 * h

Note: Haskell has other important properties (like algebraic data types, type classes, type inference, polymorphism, ...) that we'll cover in future lessons.
(Lazy and explicit effects are two of the more unique properties of Haskell. That's why they're in bold.)
